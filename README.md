Optimization/Prescriptive Analytics model for Report Generator (Excel Spreadsheets): 

Problem Statement: xyz company plans to develop a product which generates 5 categories of reports where each category can have many different reports. The total price of each report in each category is given in the table below. The table also shows development and testing time for each category and it also shows the developmental and testing cost per hour for each category. Apart from these costs, XYZ -DA spends 1 million dollars on purchasing new servers for setting up a cluster. The total available developmental time is 10000 hours and total available testing time is 3000 hours. XYZ -DA plans to sell at least 1 report in each category and determines to earn at least $100,000 in profit for the product from each customer. The goal of this project is to determine the number of reports XYZ -DA can produce in each category to maximize the profit without increasing the total development and total testing time.

An optimized integer programming solution is modeled using excel spreadsheets in order to maximize the profit of an organization. The model finds the optimal number of reports the company could sell in each category, subject to various constraints, to gain maximum profit.

Integer programming model results were compared with the linear programming model solution to show how integer programming model is a better approach for this case study. 

Both, One-way sensitivity and two-way sensitivity analysis were done to show the variation of maximum profit with respect to the variations in the constraints.
